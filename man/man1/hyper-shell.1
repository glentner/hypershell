.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBhyper\-shell\fP is an elegant, cross\-platform, high\-performance computing utility for processing
shell commands over a distributed, asynchronous queue. It is a highly scalable workflow automation
tool for many\-task scenarios.
.sp
Typically, ad hoc usage or batch jobs will use the \fBcluster\fP workflow. This automatically stands
up the \fBserver\fP and one or more \fBclient\fP instances on remote servers and processes the commands
from some input \fIFILE\fP until completion.
.sp
This can function as a pure in\-memory queue; however, one can configure a database in\-the\-loop
to manage task scheduling and persistence. Stand up the \fBserver\fP on its own and persistent
\fBclients\fP on the nodes in the cluster, and \fBsubmit\fP tasks independently.
.SH CLUSTER USAGE
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBhyper\-shell cluster [\-h]\fP
\fB[FILE | \-\-restart | \-\-forever]\fP
\fB[\-\-no\-db | \-\-initdb]\fP \fB[\-N NUM]\fP \fB[\-t CMD]\fP \fB[\-b SIZE]\fP \fB[\-w SEC]\fP

.UNINDENT
.sp
Start the cluster either locally or with remote clients over \fIssh\fP or a custom \fIlauncher\fP\&. This
mode should be the most common entry\-point for general usage. It fully encompasses all of the
different agents in the system in a concise workflow.
.sp
The input source for tasks is file\-like, either a local path, or from \fIstdin\fP if no argument is
given. The command\-line tasks are pulled in and either directly published to a distributed queue
(see \fB\-\-no\-db\fP) or committed to a database first before being scheduled later.
.sp
For large, long running workflows, it might be a good idea to configure a database and run an
initial \fBsubmit\fP job to populate the database, and then run the cluster with \fB\-\-restart\fP and no
input \fIFILE\fP\&. If the cluster is interrupted for whatever reason it can gracefully restart where it
left off.
.SS Arguments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B FILE
Path to input task file (default: <stdin>).
.UNINDENT
.SS Modes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\fP \fIHOST\fP…
Launch directly with SSH host(s). This can be a single host, a comma\-separated list of hosts,
or an expandable pattern, e.g., “cluster\-a[00\-04].xyz”.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-ssh\-group\fP and \fB\-\-ssh\-args\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-mpi\fP
Same as \fB\-\-launcher=mpirun\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-launcher\fP \fIARGS\fP…
Use specific launch interface. This can be any program that handles process management on a
distributed system. For example, on a \fISLURM\fP cluster one might want to use \fBsrun\fP\&. In this
case you would specify \fB\-\-launcher=srun\fP; however, the \fIARGS\fP are not merely the executable
but the full listing, e.g., \fB\-\-launcher=\(aqsrun \-\-mpi=pmi2\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP \fINUM\fP
Number of task executors per client (default: 1).
.sp
For example, \fB\-N4\fP would create four workers, but \fB\-N4 \-\-ssh \(aqcluster\-a[00\-01].xyz\(aq\fP
creates two clients and a total of eight workers.
.TP
.B \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP \fICMD\fP
Command\-line template pattern (default: “{}”).
.sp
This is expanded by the client just before execution. With the default “{}” the input
command\-line will be run verbatim. Specifying a template pattern allows for simple input
arguments (e.g., file paths) to be transformed into some common form; such as
\fB\-t \(aq./some_command.py {} >outputs/{/\-}.out\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
See section on \fItemplates\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-port\fP \fINUM\fP
Port number (default: 50001).
.sp
This is an arbitrary choice and simply must be an available port. The default option chosen
here is typically available on most platforms and is not expected by any known major software.
.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP \fISIZE\fP
Size of task bundle (default: 1).
.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales. This is
used by the \fIsubmit\fP thread to accumulate bundles for either database commits and/or publishing
to the queue. If a database is in use, the scheduler thread selects tasks from the database in
batches of this size.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP and \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP \fISEC\fP
Seconds to wait before flushing tasks (default: 5).
.sp
This is used by both the \fIsubmit\fP thread and forwarded to each \fIclient\fP\&. The \fIclient\fP collector
thread that accumulates finished task bundles to return to the \fIserver\fP will push out a bundle
after this period of time regardless of whether it has reached the preferred bundle size.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP \fINUM\fP
Auto\-retry failed tasks (default: 0).
.sp
If a database is in use, then there is an opportunity to automatically retry failed tasks. A
task is considered to have failed if it has a non\-zero exit status. Setting this value greater
than zero defines the number of attempts for the task. The original is not over\-written, a new
task is submitted and later scheduled.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-eager\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-eager\fP
Schedule failed tasks before new tasks. If \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP is greater than one, this option
defines the appetite for re\-submitting failed tasks. By default, failed tasks will only be
scheduled when there are no more remaining novel tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-db\fP
Disable database (submit directly to clients).
.sp
By default, a scheduler thread selects tasks from a database that were previously submitted.
With \fB\-\-no\-db\fP enabled, there is no scheduler and instead the \fIsubmit\fP thread publishes
bundles directly to the queue.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-initdb\fP
Auto\-initialize database.
.sp
If a database is configured for use with the workflow (e.g., PostgreSQL), auto\-initialize
tables if they don’t already exist. This is a short\-hand for pre\-creating tables with the
\fBhyper\-shell initdb\fP command. This happens by default with SQLite databases.
.sp
Mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-no\-db\fP\&. See \fBhyper\-shell initdb\fP command.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-forever\fP
Schedule forever.
.sp
Typically, the \fIcluster\fP will process some finite set of submitted tasks. When there are
no more tasks left to schedule, the \fIcluster\fP will begin its shutdown procedure. With
\fB\-\-forever\fP enabled, the scheduler will continue to wait for new tasks indefinitely.
.sp
Conflicts with \fB\-\-no\-db\fP and mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-restart\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-restart\fP
Start scheduling from last completed task.
.sp
Instead of pulling a new list of tasks from some input \fIFILE\fP, with \fB\-\-restart\fP enabled the
\fIcluster\fP will restart scheduling tasks where it left off. Any task in the database that was
previously scheduled but not completed will be reverted.
.sp
For very large workflows, an effective strategy is to first use the \fBsubmit\fP workflow to
populate the database, and then to use \fB\-\-restart\fP so that if the \fIcluster\fP is interrupted,
it can easily continue where it left off, halting if nothing to be done.
.sp
Conflicts with \fB\-\-no\-db\fP and mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-forever\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\-args\fP \fIARGS\fP…
Command\-line arguments for SSH. For example, \fB\-\-ssh\-args \(aq\-i ~/.ssh/my_key\(aq\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\-group\fP \fINAME\fP
SSH nodelist group in config.
.sp
In your configuration under \fB[ssh.nodelist]\fP can be one or more named lists. These lists
should contain host names to associate with the group name.
.sp
See \fIconfiguration\fP section.
.TP
.B \fB\-E\fP, \fB\-\-env\fP
Send environment variables. Only for \fB\-\-ssh\fP mode, all \fBHYPERSHELL_\fP prefixed environment
variables can be exported to the remote clients.
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP \fISEC\fP
Delay time in seconds for launching clients (default: 0).
.sp
At larger scales it can be advantageous to uniformly delay the client launch sequence.
Hundreds or thousands of clients connecting to the server all at once is a challenge.
Even if the server could handle the load, your task throughput would be unbalanced,
coming in waves.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP with a negative number to impose a uniform random delay up to the
magnitude specified (e.g., \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-600\fP would delay the client up to ten minutes).
This also has the effect of staggering the workload. If your tasks take on the order of 30
minutes and you have 1000 nodes, choose \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-1800\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-capture\fP
Capture individual task <stdout> and <stderr>.
.sp
By default, the \fIstdout\fP and \fIstderr\fP streams of all tasks are fused with that of the \fIclient\fP
thread, and in turn the \fIcluster\fP\&. If tasks are producing output that needs to be isolated, the
tasks need to manage their own output, you can specify a redirect as part of a \fB\-\-template\fP,
or use \fB\-\-capture\fP to capture these as \fB\&.out\fP and \fB\&.err\fP files.
.sp
These are stored local to the \fIclient\fP\&. Task outputs can be automatically retrieved via SFTP,
see \fItask\fP usage.
.TP
.B \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task outputs (default: <stdout>).
.sp
If local only (not \fB\-\-ssh\fP, \fB\-\-mpi\fP or \fB\-\-launcher\fP), then the \fIclient\fP can redirect all
\fIstdout\fP from tasks to some file \fIPATH\fP together.
.TP
.B \fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-errors\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task errors (default: <stderr>).
.sp
If local only (not \fB\-\-ssh\fP, \fB\-\-mpi\fP or \fB\-\-launcher\fP), then the \fIclient\fP can redirect all
\fIstderr\fP from tasks to some file \fIPATH\fP together.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-failures\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path to write failed task args (default: <none>).
.sp
The \fIserver\fP acts like a sieve, reading task args from \fIstdin\fP and redirecting those original
args to \fIstdout\fP if the task had a non\-zero exit status. The \fIcluster\fP will run the \fIserver\fP
for you and if \fB\-\-failures\fP is enabled these task args will be sent to a local file \fIPATH\fP\&.

Launch server, schedule directly or asynchronously from database.
.sp
The server includes a scheduler component that pulls tasks from the database and offers
them up on a distributed queue to clients. It also has a receiver that collects the results
of finished tasks. Optionally, the server can submit tasks (\fIFILE\fP). When submitting tasks,
the \fB\-w\fP/\fB\-\-bundlewait\fP and \fB\-b\fP/\fBbundlesize\fP options are the same as for the
\fIsubmit\fP workflow.
.sp
With \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP greater than zero, the scheduler will check for a non\-zero exit status
for tasks and re\-submit them if their previous number of attempts is less.
.sp
Tasks are bundled and clients pull them in these bundles. However, by default the bundle size
is one, meaning that at small scales there is greater concurrency.

.SH TEMPLATES
.sp
Incoming command\-line arguments are expanded using a template pattern.
Workloads often have a common form and only a small part of the shell command
need be different.
.sp
Braces, \fB{}\fP, are used in all cases. Empty braces will substitute the full
incoming argument line. Use one of the below patterns as a shorthand notation
for many common scenarios.
.sp
The \fB\-t\fP/\fB\-\-template\fP argument is used by the \fBclient\fP command to expand
templates just prior to execution. The \fBcluster\fP command simply forwards this
argument to all clients.
.sp
In some situations it may be useful to expand a template with the \fBsubmit\fP command.
These are expanded \fIprior\fP to scheduling as the actual \fIargs\fP for the task.
.SS Filepath Operations
.sp
Shell commands often operate on filepaths. In such cases, it may be useful to manipulate
these paths. Instead of using a shell interpolation (see below), use one of the available
shorthand notations listed here.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{.}\fP
Expand to immediate parent directory of given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path/to\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{..}\fP
Expand to second parent directory of given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{/}\fP
The basename of the given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBfile.h5\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{/\-}\fP
The basename of the given file without its file type extension.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBfile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{\-}\fP
The full path of the given file without the extension.
This is useful for targeting adjacent files with a different extension.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path/to/file\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{+}\fP
The file type extension for the given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB\&.h5\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{++}\fP
The file type extension for the given file without the leading dot.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBh5\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Argument Slicing
.sp
Command\-line inputs are understood as individual arguments delimited by whitespace.
Slice into the argument vector using the \fB{[]}\fP notation. Arguments follow zero\-based
indexing. Negative index values are counting backwards from the end.
.sp
Select with a singular value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[0]}\fP
The first argument.
.TP
.B \fB{[1]}\fP

.B \fB{[\-1]}\fP
The last argument.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Select a range with a \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP value, non\-inclusive of the \fIstop\fP value.
Including a leading or trailing colon implies the default value (inclusive).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[1:3]}\fP

.TP
.B \fB{[\-2:]}\fP
The last two arguments.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Include a third value as a \fIstep\fP (or sometimes referred to as \fIstride\fP).
Leaving out the \fIstart\fP and \fIstep\fP value implies starting from the first element (inclusive).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[::2]}\fP

.TP
.B \fB{[1::2]}\fP
Every odd argument.

The incoming command\-line args can be substituted with an \fB@\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{% basename @ %}\fP

.TP
.B \fB{% mktemp \-d %}\fP

.UNINDENT
.SS Lambda Expressions
.sp
Arbitrary Python expressions can be expanded with the \fB{= =}\fP notation.
The input argument can be used within the expression with the variable \fBx\fP\&.
.sp
Exposed standard library modules include \fBos\fP, \fBos.path\fP as \fBpath\fP,
\fBmath\fP and \fBdatetime\fP as \fBdt\fP\&.
.sp
Incoming arguments are intelligently coerced into the expected type.
E.g., \fB2\fP will be an integer, \fB4.67\fP a float, \fBnull\fP and \fBnone\fP
will be a Python \fBNone\fP, and \fBtrue\fP/\fBfalse\fP will be the appropriate
boolean value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{= x * math.pi =}\fP
Multiply the incoming argument (expected to be a float) by Pi.
.TP
.B \fB{= dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(x) =}\fP
Convert incoming POSIX timestamp to ISO format.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Most of the choices that \fBhyper\-shell\fP makes about timing, task bundling, coordination, logging,
and such are configurable by the user. This configuration is loaded when \fBhyper\-shell\fP starts
and is constructed from several sources including an ordered merger of files, environment variables,
and command\-line options.
.sp
In order of precedence (lowest to highest), three files are loaded:
.TS
center;
|l|l|.
_
T{
Level
T}	T{
Path
T}
_
T{
System
T}	T{
\fB/etc/hypershell.toml\fP

_
T{

T}	T{
\fB~/.hypershell/config.toml\fP
T}
_
T{
Local
T}	T{
\fB\&./.hypershell/config.toml\fP
T}
_
.TE
.sp
The \fI\%TOML\fP format is modern and minimal.
.sp
Every configurable option can be set in one of these files. Further, every option can
also be set by an environment variable, where the name aligns to the path
to that option, delimited by underscores.
.sp
For example, set the logging level at the user level with a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hyper\-shell config set logging.level info \-\-user
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The file should now look something like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# File automatically created on 2022\-07\-02 11:57:29.332993
# Settings here are merged automatically with defaults and environment variables

[logging]
level = \(dqinfo\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, you can set an environment variable and the runtime configuration
would be equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ export HYPERSHELL_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, any option defined within a configuration file that ends with \fB_env\fP or \fB_eval\fP
is automatically expanded by the given environment variable or shell expression,
respectively. This is useful as both a dynamic feature but also as a means to
obfuscate sensitive information, such as database connection details.

.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.provider\fP
Database provider (default: ‘sqlite’). Supported alternatives include
‘postgres’ (or compatible). Support for other providers may be considered in
the future.
.TP
.B \fB\&.file\fP
Only applicable for SQLite provider.
SQLite does not understand any other connection detail.
.TP
.B \fB\&.database\fP
Name for database. Not applicable for SQLite.
.TP
.B \fB\&.schema\fP
Not applicable for all RDMS providers.
For PostgreSQL the default schema is \fBpublic\fP\&.
Specifying the schema may be useful for having multiple instances within the same database.
.TP
.B \fB\&.host\fP
Hostname or address of database server (default: \fIlocalhost\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\&.port\fP
Port number to connect with database server.
The default value depends on the provider, e.g., 5432 for PostgreSQL.
.TP
.B \fB\&.user\fP
Username for databaser server account.
If provided a \fBpassword\fP must also be provided.
Default is the local account.
.TP

.TP
.B \fB\&.echo\fP
Special parameter enables verbose logging of all database transactions.
.TP
.B \fB[connection_args]\fP

e.g., \fBsqlite3\fP or \fBpsycopg2\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB*\fP
Any additional arguments are forwarded to the provider, e.g., \fBencoding = \(aqutf\-8\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB[server]\fP
Section for \fIserver\fP workflow parameters.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.bind\fP
Bind address (default: \fIlocalhost\fP).
.sp
When running locally, the default is recommended. To allow remote \fIclients\fP to connect
over the network, bind the server to \fI0.0.0.0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.port\fP
Port number (default: \fI50001\fP).
.sp
This is an arbitrary choice and simply must be an available port. The default option chosen
here is typically available on most platforms and is not expected by any known major software.
.TP
.B \fB\&.auth\fP
Cryptographic authorization key to connect with server (default: \fI<not secure>\fP).
.sp
The default \fIKEY\fP used by the server and client is not secure and only a place holder.
It is expected that the user choose a secure \fIKEY\fP\&. The \fIcluster\fP automatically generates
a secure one\-time \fIKEY\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.queuesize\fP
Maximum number of task bundles on the shared queue (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
This blocks the next bundle from being published by the scheduler until a client
has taken the current prepared bundle. On smaller scales this is probably best and
is only of modest performance impact, limiting the scheduler from getting so far ahead
of the currently running tasks.
.sp
On large scale workflows with many clients (e.g., 100) it may be advantageous to allow
the scheduler to work ahead in selecting new tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\&.bundlesize\fP
Size of task bundle (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales. This is
used by the \fIsubmit\fP thread to accumulate bundles for either database commits and/or publishing
to the queue. If a database is in use, the scheduler thread selects tasks from the database in
batches of this size.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fB\&.attempts\fP
Attempts for auto\-retry on failed tasks (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
If a database is in use, then there is an opportunity to automatically retry failed tasks. A
task is considered to have failed if it has a non\-zero exit status. The original is not over\-written,
a new task is submitted and later scheduled.
.sp
Counterpart to the \fB\-r\fP/\fB\-\-max\-retries\fP command\-line option. Setting \fB\-\-max\-retries 1\fP
is equivalent to setting \fB\&.attempts\fP to 2.
.sp
See also \fB\&.eager\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.eager\fP
Schedule failed tasks before new tasks (default: \fIfalse\fP).
.sp
If \fB\&.attempts\fP is greater than one, this option defines the appetite for re\-submitting
failed tasks. By default, failed tasks will only be scheduled when there are no more
remaining novel tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\&.wait\fP
Polling interval in seconds for database queries during scheduling (default: \fI5\fP).
This waiting only occurs when no tasks are returned by the query.
.TP
.B \fB\&.evict\fP
Eviction period in seconds for clients (default: \fI600\fP).
.sp
If a client fails to register a heartbeat after this period of time it is considered
defunct and is evicted. When there are no more tasks to schedule the server sends a
disconnect request to all registered clients, and waits until a confirmation is
returned for each. If a client is defunct, this will hang the shutdown process.

.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for larger distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client. It is also a good
idea to coordinate bundle size between the client and server so that the client returns the
same sized bundles that it receives.
.sp
See also \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fB\&.bundlewait\fP
Seconds to wait before flushing task bundle (default: \fI5\fP).
.sp
If this period of time expires since the previous bundle was returned to the server,
the current group of finished tasks will be pushed regardless of \fIbundlesize\fP\&.
.sp
For larger distributed workflows it is a good idea to make this waiting period sufficiently
long so that most bundles are returned whole.

Further, any environment variable starting with \fBHYPERSHELL_EXPORT_\fP will be injected
into the task environment sans prefix; e.g., \fBHYPERSHELL_EXPORT_FOO\fP would define
\fBFOO\fP in the task environment. You can also define such variables in the \fBexport\fP
section of your configuration file(s); e.g.,
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
