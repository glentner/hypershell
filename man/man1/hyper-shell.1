.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
HyperShell is an elegant, cross\-platform, high\-throughput computing utility for processing
shell commands over a distributed, asynchronous queue. It is a highly scalable workflow automation
tool for many\-task scenarios.
.sp
Typically, ad hoc usage or batch jobs will use the \fBcluster\fP workflow. This automatically stands
up the \fBserver\fP and one or more \fBclient\fP instances on remote servers and processes the commands
from some input \fIFILE\fP until completion.
.sp
Operate with an in\-memory queue, or configure a database to manage task scheduling and persistence.
Stand up the \fBserver\fP on its own and scale \fBclients\fP as desired, and \fBsubmit\fP tasks independently.

.UNINDENT
.sp
Start cluster locally or with remote clients over \fIssh\fP or a custom \fIlauncher\fP\&.
This mode should be the most common entry\-point for general usage. It fully encompasses all of the
different agents in the system in a concise workflow.
.sp
The input source for tasks is file\-like, either a local path, or from \fIstdin\fP if no argument is
given. The command\-line tasks are pulled in and either directly published to a distributed queue
(see \fB\-\-no\-db\fP) or committed to a database first before being scheduled later.
.sp
For large, long running workflows, it might be a good idea to configure a database and run an
initial \fBsubmit\fP job to populate the database, and then run the cluster with \fB\-\-restart\fP and no
input \fIFILE\fP\&. If the cluster is interrupted for whatever reason it can gracefully restart where it
left off.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP with either \fIfixed\fP or \fIdynamic\fP to run a persistent, elastically scalable
cluster using an external \fB\-\-launcher\fP to bring up clients as needed.
.SS Arguments
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B FILE
Path to input task file (default: <stdin>).
.UNINDENT
.SS Modes
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\fP \fIHOST\fP…
Launch directly with SSH host(s). This can be a single host, a comma\-separated list of hosts,
or an expandable pattern, e.g., “cluster\-a[00\-04].xyz”.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-ssh\-group\fP and \fB\-\-ssh\-args\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-mpi\fP
Same as \fB\-\-launcher=mpirun\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-launcher\fP \fIARGS\fP…
Use specific launch interface. This can be any program that handles process management on a
distributed system. For example, on a \fISLURM\fP cluster one might want to use \fBsrun\fP\&. In this
case you would specify \fB\-\-launcher=srun\fP; however, the \fIARGS\fP are not merely the executable
but the full listing, e.g., \fB\-\-launcher=\(aqsrun \-\-mpi=pmi2\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP \fINUM\fP
Number of task executors per client (default: 1).
.sp
For example, \fB\-N4\fP would create four workers, but \fB\-N4 \-\-ssh \(aqcluster\-a[00\-01].xyz\(aq\fP
creates two clients and a total of eight workers.
.TP
.B \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP \fICMD\fP
Command\-line template pattern (default: “{}”).
.sp
This is expanded by the client just before execution. With the default “{}” the input
command\-line will be run verbatim. Specifying a template pattern allows for simple input
arguments (e.g., file paths) to be transformed into some common form; such as
\fB\-t \(aq./some_command.py {} >outputs/{/\-}.out\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
See section on \fItemplates\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-port\fP \fINUM\fP
Port number (default: 50001).
.sp
This is an arbitrary choice and simply must be an available port. The default option chosen
here is typically available on most platforms and is not expected by any known major software.
.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP \fISIZE\fP
Size of task bundle (default: 1).
.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales. This is
used by the \fIsubmit\fP thread to accumulate bundles for either database commits and/or publishing
to the queue. If a database is in use, the scheduler thread selects tasks from the database in
batches of this size.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP and \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP \fISEC\fP
Seconds to wait before flushing tasks (default: 5).
.sp
This is used by both the \fIsubmit\fP thread and forwarded to each \fIclient\fP\&. The \fIclient\fP collector
thread that accumulates finished task bundles to return to the \fIserver\fP will push out a bundle
after this period of time regardless of whether it has reached the preferred bundle size.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP \fINUM\fP
Auto\-retry failed tasks (default: 0).
.sp
If a database is in use, then there is an opportunity to automatically retry failed tasks. A
task is considered to have failed if it has a non\-zero exit status. Setting this value greater
than zero defines the number of attempts for the task. The original is not over\-written, a new
task is submitted and later scheduled.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-eager\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-eager\fP
Schedule failed tasks before new tasks. If \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP is greater than one, this option
defines the appetite for re\-submitting failed tasks. By default, failed tasks will only be
scheduled when there are no more remaining novel tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-db\fP
Disable database (submit directly to clients).
.sp
By default, a scheduler thread selects tasks from a database that were previously submitted.
With \fB\-\-no\-db\fP enabled, there is no scheduler and instead the \fIsubmit\fP thread publishes
bundles directly to the queue.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-initdb\fP
Auto\-initialize database.
.sp
If a database is configured for use with the workflow (e.g., Postgres), auto\-initialize
tables if they don’t already exist. This is a short\-hand for pre\-creating tables with the
\fBhs initdb\fP command. This happens by default with SQLite databases.
.sp
Mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-no\-db\fP\&. See \fBhs initdb\fP command.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-confirm\fP
Disable client confirmation of task bundle received.
.sp
To achieve even higher throughput at large scales, optionally disable confirmation
payloads from clients. Consider using this option when also using \fB\-\-no\-db\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-forever\fP
Schedule forever.
.sp
Typically, the \fIcluster\fP will process some finite set of submitted tasks. When there are
no more tasks left to schedule, the \fIcluster\fP will begin its shutdown procedure. With
\fB\-\-forever\fP enabled, the scheduler will continue to wait for new tasks indefinitely.
.sp
Conflicts with \fB\-\-no\-db\fP and mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-restart\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-restart\fP
Start scheduling from last completed task.
.sp
Instead of pulling a new list of tasks from some input \fIFILE\fP, with \fB\-\-restart\fP enabled the
\fIcluster\fP will restart scheduling tasks where it left off. Any task in the database that was
previously scheduled but not completed will be reverted.
.sp
For very large workflows, an effective strategy is to first use the \fBsubmit\fP workflow to
populate the database, and then to use \fB\-\-restart\fP so that if the \fIcluster\fP is interrupted,
it can easily continue where it left off, halting if nothing to be done.
.sp
Conflicts with \fB\-\-no\-db\fP and mutually exclusive to \fB\-\-forever\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\-args\fP \fIARGS\fP…
Command\-line arguments for SSH. For example, \fB\-\-ssh\-args \(aq\-i ~/.ssh/my_key\(aq\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-ssh\-group\fP \fINAME\fP
SSH nodelist group in config.
.sp
In your configuration under \fB[ssh.nodelist]\fP can be one or more named lists. These lists
should contain host names to associate with the group name.
.sp
See \fIconfiguration\fP section.
.TP
.B \fB\-E\fP, \fB\-\-env\fP
Send environment variables. Only for \fB\-\-ssh\fP mode, all \fBHYPERSHELL_\fP prefixed environment
variables can be exported to the remote clients.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-remote\-exe\fP \fIPATH\fP
Path to remote executable on the client side.
.sp
By default the executable path used to launch clients is the same as that for the cluster.
This option is necessary for clients with a different install path on client hosts.
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP \fISEC\fP
Delay time in seconds for launching clients (default: 0).
.sp
At larger scales it can be advantageous to uniformly delay the client launch sequence.
Hundreds or thousands of clients connecting to the server all at once is a challenge.
Even if the server could handle the load, your task throughput would be unbalanced,
coming in waves.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP with a negative number to impose a uniform random delay up to the
magnitude specified (e.g., \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-600\fP would delay the client up to ten minutes).
This also has the effect of staggering the workload. If your tasks take on the order of 30
minutes and you have 1000 nodes, choose \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-1800\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-capture\fP
Capture individual task <stdout> and <stderr>.
.sp
By default, the \fIstdout\fP and \fIstderr\fP streams of all tasks are fused with that of the \fIclient\fP
thread, and in turn the \fIcluster\fP\&. If tasks are producing output that needs to be isolated, the
tasks need to manage their own output, you can specify a redirect as part of a \fB\-\-template\fP,
or use \fB\-\-capture\fP to capture these as \fB\&.out\fP and \fB\&.err\fP files.
.sp
These are stored local to the \fIclient\fP\&. Task outputs can be automatically retrieved via SFTP,
see \fItask\fP usage.
.TP
.B \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task outputs (default: <stdout>).
.sp
If local only (not \fB\-\-ssh\fP, \fB\-\-mpi\fP or \fB\-\-launcher\fP), then the \fIclient\fP can redirect all
\fIstdout\fP from tasks to some file \fIPATH\fP together.
.TP
.B \fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-errors\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task errors (default: <stderr>).
.sp
If local only (not \fB\-\-ssh\fP, \fB\-\-mpi\fP or \fB\-\-launcher\fP), then the \fIclient\fP can redirect all
\fIstderr\fP from tasks to some file \fIPATH\fP together.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-failures\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path to write failed task args (default: <none>).
.sp
The \fIserver\fP acts like a sieve, reading task args from \fIstdin\fP and redirecting those original
args to \fIstdout\fP if the task had a non\-zero exit status. The \fIcluster\fP will run the \fIserver\fP
for you and if \fB\-\-failures\fP is enabled these task args will be sent to a local file \fIPATH\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-\-timeout\fP \fISEC\fP
Timeout in seconds for clients. Automatically shutdown if no tasks received (default: never).
.sp
This option is only valid for an \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP cluster. This feature allows for gracefully
scaling down a cluster when task throughput subsides.
.TP
.B \fB\-W\fP, \fB\-\-task\-timeout\fP \fISEC\fP
Task\-level walltime limit (default: none).
.sp
Executors will send a progression of SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
If the process still persists the executor itself will shutdown.
.TP
.B \fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-signalwait\fP \fISEC\fP
Task\-level signal escalation wait period in seconds (default: 10).
.sp
When tasks fail to halt following an initial SIGINT, the program waits
this interval in seconds before escalating to the next level of interrupt.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-task\-timeout\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-A\fP, \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP [\fIMODE\fP]
Enable autoscaling (default: disabled). Used with \fB\-\-launcher\fP\&.
.sp
Specifying this option on its own triggers the use of the autoscaler, with the default
\fIpolicy\fP or the configured policy. The \fIpolicy\fP can be specified directly here
as either \fIfixed\fP or \fIdynamic\fP (e.g., \fB\-\-autoscaling=dynamic\fP). The default is \fIfixed\fP\&.
.sp
The specified \fB\-\-launcher\fP is used to bring up each individual instance of the client
as a discrete scaling unit. This is different than using \fB\-\-launcher\fP on its own where
it specifies a single invocation that should launch all clients (e.g., like an \fBmpirun\fP).
Without this option, clients will simply be run locally.
.sp
A \fIfixed\fP policy will seek to maintain a definite size and allows for recovery in the
event that clients halt for some reason (e.g., due to expected faults or timeouts).
.sp
A \fIdynamic\fP policy maintains a \fB\-\-min\-size\fP (default: 0) and grows up to some
\fB\-\-max\-size\fP depending on the observed \fItask pressure\fP given the specified scaling
\fB\-\-factor\fP\&.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-factor\fP, \fB\-\-period\fP, \fB\-\-init\-size\fP, \fB\-\-min\-size\fP, and \fB\-\-max\-size\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-factor\fP \fIVALUE\fP
Scaling factor (default: 1).
.sp
A configurable, dimensionless quantity used by the \fB\-\-autoscaling=dynamic\fP policy.
This value expresses some multiple of the average task duration in seconds.
.sp
The autoscaler periodically checks \fBtoc / (factor x avg_duration)\fP, where
\fBtoc\fP is the estimated time of completion for all remaining tasks given current
throughput of active clients. This ratio is referred to as \fItask pressure\fP, and if
it exceeds 1, the pressure is considered \fIhigh\fP and we will add another client if
we are not already at the given \fB\-\-max\-size\fP of the cluster.
.sp
For example, if the average task length is 30 minutes, and we set \fB\-\-factor=2\fP, then if
the estimated time of completion of remaining tasks given currently connected executors
exceeds 1 hour, we will scale up by one unit.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-period\fP\&.  Only valid with \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-\-period\fP \fISEC\fP
Scaling period in seconds (default: 60).
.sp
The autoscaler waits for this period of time in between checks and scaling events.
A shorter period makes the scaling behavior more responsive but can effect database
performance if checks happen too rapidly.
.sp
Only valid with \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-init\-size\fP \fISIZE\fP
Initial size of cluster (default: 1).
.sp
When the cluster starts, this number of clients will be launched.
For a \fIfixed\fP policy cluster, this should be given with a \fB\-\-min\-size\fP, and likely
the same value.
.sp
Only valid with \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-X\fP, \fB\-\-min\-size\fP \fISIZE\fP
Minimum size of cluster (default: 0).
.sp
Regardless of autoscaling policy, if the number of launched clients drops below this
value we will scale up by one. Allowing \fB\-\-min\-size=0\fP is an important feature for
efficient use of computing resources in the absence of tasks.
.sp
Only valid with \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-Y\fP, \fB\-\-max\-size\fP \fISIZE\fP
Maximum size of cluster (default: 2).
.sp
For a \fIdynamic\fP autoscaling policy, this sets an upper limit on the number of launched
clients. When this number is reached, scaling stops regardless of task pressure.
.sp
Only valid with \fB\-\-autoscaling\fP\&.

Launch server, schedule directly or asynchronously from database.
.sp
The server includes a scheduler component that pulls tasks from the database and offers
them up on a distributed queue to clients. It also has a receiver that collects the results
of finished tasks. Optionally, the server can submit tasks (\fIFILE\fP). When submitting tasks,
the \fB\-w\fP/\fB\-\-bundlewait\fP and \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP options are the same as for the
\fIsubmit\fP workflow.
.sp
With \fB\-\-max\-retries\fP greater than zero, the scheduler will check for a non\-zero exit status
for tasks and re\-submit them if their previous number of attempts is less.
.sp
Tasks are bundled and clients pull them in these bundles. However, by default the bundle size
is one, meaning that at small scales there is greater concurrency.

It is expected that the user choose a secure \fIKEY\fP\&. The \fIcluster\fP automatically generates
a secure one\-time \fIKEY\fP\&.

Launch client directly, run tasks in parallel.

The client connects to the server and pulls bundles of tasks off the shared queue.
These tasks are run locally by some number of a parallel task executors.

for tasks are forwarded to that of the client, unless \fB\-\-capture\fP is used, in which
these are directed to individual files for each task.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-N\fP, \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP \fINUM\fP
Number of task executors (default: 1).
.TP
.B \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-\-template\fP \fICMD\fP
Command\-line template pattern (default: “{}”).
.sp
This is expanded by the client just before execution. With the default “{}” the input
command\-line will be run verbatim. Specifying a template pattern allows for simple input
arguments (e.g., file paths) to be transformed into some common form; such as
\fB\-t \(aq./some_command.py {} >outputs/{/\-}.out\(aq\fP\&.
.sp
See section on \fItemplates\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP \fISIZE\fP
Size of task bundle (default: 1).
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-num\-tasks\fP and \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-bundlewait\fP \fISEC\fP
Seconds to wait before flushing tasks (default: 5).
.sp
The \fIclient\fP collector thread that accumulates finished task bundles to return to
the \fIserver\fP will push out a bundle after this period of time regardless of whether
it has reached the preferred bundle size.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-H\fP, \fB\-\-host\fP \fIADDR\fP
Hostname or IP address to connect with server (default: localhost).
.TP
.B \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-\-port\fP \fINUM\fP
Port number to connect with server (default: 50001).
.TP
.B \fB\-k\fP, \fB\-\-auth\fP \fIKEY\fP
Cryptographic authentication key to connect with server (default: <not secure>).
.sp
The default \fIKEY\fP used by the server and client is not secure and only a place holder.
It is expected that the user choose a secure \fIKEY\fP\&. The \fIcluster\fP automatically generates
a secure one\-time \fIKEY\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP \fISEC\fP
Delay time in seconds before connecting to server (default: 0).
.sp
At larger scales it can be advantageous to uniformly delay the client launch sequence.
Hundreds or thousands of clients connecting to the server all at once is a challenge.
Even if the server could handle the load, your task throughput would be unbalanced,
coming in waves.
.sp
Use \fB\-\-delay\-start\fP with a negative number to impose a uniform random delay up to the
magnitude specified (e.g., \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-600\fP would delay the client up to ten minutes).
This also has the effect of staggering the workload. If your tasks take on the order of 30
minutes and you have 1000 nodes, choose \fB\-\-delay\-start=\-1800\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-confirm\fP
Disable client confirmation of task bundle received.
.sp
To achieve even higher throughput at large scales, optionally disable confirmation
payloads from clients. Consider using this option when also using \fB\-\-no\-db\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-o\fP, \fB\-\-output\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task outputs (default: <stdout>).
.TP
.B \fB\-e\fP, \fB\-\-errors\fP \fIPATH\fP
File path for task errors (default: <stderr>).
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-capture\fP
Capture individual task <stdout> and <stderr>.
.sp
By default, the \fIstdout\fP and \fIstderr\fP streams of all tasks are fused with that of the \fIclient\fP
thread, and in turn the \fIcluster\fP\&. If tasks are producing output that needs to be isolated, the
tasks need to manage their own output, you can specify a redirect as part of a \fB\-\-template\fP,
or use \fB\-\-capture\fP to capture these as \fB\&.out\fP and \fB\&.err\fP files.
.sp
These are stored local to the \fIclient\fP under \fI<prefix>/lib/task/<uuid>.[out,err]\fP\&.
Task outputs can be automatically retrieved via SFTP, see \fItask\fP usage.
.sp
Mutually exclusive with both \fB\-\-output\fP and \fB\-\-errors\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-timeout\fP \fISEC\fP
Timeout in seconds for client. Automatically shutdown if no tasks received (default: never).
.sp
This feature allows for gracefully scaling down a cluster when task throughput subsides.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-task\-timeout\fP \fISEC\fP
Task\-level walltime limit (default: none).
.sp
Executors will send a progression of SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
If the process still persists the executor itself will shutdown.
.TP
.B \fB\-S\fP, \fB\-\-signalwait\fP \fISEC\fP
Task\-level signal escalation wait period in seconds (default: 10).
.sp
When tasks fail to halt following an initial SIGINT, the program waits
this interval in seconds before escalating to the next level of interrupt.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-task\-timeout\fP\&.

Submit tasks from file.
.sp
Tasks are accumulated and published in bundles to the database.
The \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP and \fB\-w\fP/\fB\-\-bundlewait\fP options control the
size of these bundles and how long to wait before flushing tasks regardless of
how many have accumulated.

.TP
.B \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP \fISIZE\fP
Size of task bundle (default: 1).

The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales.
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp

The current bundle will be pushed regardless of how many tasks have been accumulated.
.sp
See also \fB\-\-bundlesize\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-initdb\fP
Auto\-initialize database.
.sp
If a database is configured for use with the workflow (e.g., Postgres), auto\-initialize
tables if they don’t already exist. This is a short\-hand for pre\-creating tables with the
\fBhs initdb\fP command. This happens by default with SQLite databases.
.sp
See \fBhs initdb\fP command.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-tag\fP \fITAG\fP…
Assign one or more tags.
.sp
Tags allow for user\-defined tracking of information related to individual tasks or large
groups of tasks. They are defined with both a \fIkey\fP and \fIvalue\fP (e.g., \fB\-\-tag file:a\fP).
The default \fIvalue\fP for tags is blank. When searching with tags, not specifying a \fIvalue\fP

.SH TEMPLATES
.sp
Incoming command\-line arguments are expanded using a template pattern.
Workloads often have a common form and only a small part of the shell command
need be different.
.sp
Braces, \fB{}\fP, are used in all cases. Empty braces will substitute the full
incoming argument line. Use one of the below patterns as a shorthand notation
for many common scenarios.
.sp
The \fB\-t\fP/\fB\-\-template\fP argument is used by the \fBclient\fP command to expand
templates just prior to execution. The \fBcluster\fP command simply forwards this
argument to all clients.
.sp
In some situations it may be useful to expand a template with the \fBsubmit\fP command.
These are expanded \fIprior\fP to scheduling as the actual \fIargs\fP for the task.
.SS Filepath Operations
.sp
Shell commands often operate on filepaths. In such cases, it may be useful to manipulate
these paths. Instead of using a shell interpolation (see below), use one of the available
shorthand notations listed here.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{.}\fP
Expand to immediate parent directory of given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path/to\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{..}\fP
Expand to second parent directory of given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{/}\fP
The basename of the given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBfile.h5\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{/\-}\fP
The basename of the given file without its file type extension.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBfile\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{\-}\fP
The full path of the given file without the extension.
This is useful for targeting adjacent files with a different extension.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB/some/path/to/file\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{+}\fP
The file type extension for the given file.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fB\&.h5\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{++}\fP
The file type extension for the given file without the leading dot.
E.g., \fB/some/path/to/file.h5\fP translates to \fBh5\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.SS Argument Slicing
.sp
Command\-line inputs are understood as individual arguments delimited by whitespace.
Slice into the argument vector using the \fB{[]}\fP notation. Arguments follow zero\-based
indexing. Negative index values are counting backwards from the end.
.sp
Select with a singular value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[0]}\fP
The first argument.
.TP
.B \fB{[1]}\fP
The second argument.
.TP
.B \fB{[\-1]}\fP
The last argument.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Select a range with a \fIstart\fP and \fIstop\fP value, non\-inclusive of the \fIstop\fP value.
Including a leading or trailing colon implies the default value (inclusive).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[1:3]}\fP
The second and third argument.
.TP
.B \fB{[:4]}\fP
The first four arguments.
.TP
.B \fB{[\-2:]}\fP
The last two arguments.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Include a third value as a \fIstep\fP (or sometimes referred to as \fIstride\fP).
Leaving out the \fIstart\fP and \fIstep\fP value implies starting from the first element (inclusive).
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{[::2]}\fP
Every second argument starting from the first.
.TP
.B \fB{[1::2]}\fP
Every odd argument.
.UNINDENT
.SS Shell Expansion
.sp
General purpose shell commands can be expanded with the \fB{% %}\fP notation.
The incoming command\-line args can be substituted with an \fB@\fP\&.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{% basename @ %}\fP
Equivalent to \fB{/}\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB{% mktemp \-d %}\fP
Create temporary directory and insert its path.
.UNINDENT
.SS Lambda Expressions
.sp
Arbitrary Python expressions can be expanded with the \fB{= =}\fP notation.
The input argument can be used within the expression with the variable \fBx\fP\&.
.sp
Exposed standard library modules include \fBos\fP, \fBos.path\fP as \fBpath\fP,
\fBmath\fP and \fBdatetime\fP as \fBdt\fP\&.
.sp
Incoming arguments are intelligently coerced into the expected type.
E.g., \fB2\fP will be an integer, \fB4.67\fP a float, \fBnull\fP and \fBnone\fP
will be a Python \fBNone\fP, and \fBtrue\fP/\fBfalse\fP will be the appropriate
boolean value.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB{= x * math.pi =}\fP
Multiply the incoming argument (expected to be a float) by Pi.
.TP
.B \fB{= dt.datetime.fromtimestamp(x) =}\fP
Convert incoming POSIX timestamp to ISO format.
.UNINDENT
.SH CONFIGURATION
.sp
Most of the choices the program makes about timing, task bundling, coordination, logging,
and such are configurable by the user. This configuration is loaded when the program starts
and is constructed from several sources including an ordered merger of files, environment variables,
and command\-line options.
.sp
In order of precedence (lowest to highest), three files are loaded:
.TS
box center;
l|l|l.

.sp
.sp
The \X'tty: link https://toml.io'\fI\%TOML\fP\X'tty: link' format is modern and minimal.
.sp
Every configurable option can be set in one of these files. Further, every option can
also be set by an environment variable, where the name aligns to the path
to that option, delimited by underscores.
.sp
For example, set the logging level at the user level with a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$ hs config set logging.level info \-\-user
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The file should now look something like this:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
# File automatically created on 2022\-07\-02 11:57:29.332993
# Settings here are merged automatically with defaults and environment variables

[logging]
level = \(dqinfo\(dq
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Alternatively, you can set an environment variable and the runtime configuration
would be equivalent:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.EX
$ export HYPERSHELL_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
.EE
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Finally, any option defined within a configuration file that ends with \fB_env\fP or \fB_eval\fP
is automatically expanded by the given environment variable or shell expression,
respectively. This is useful as both a dynamic feature but also as a means to
obfuscate sensitive information, such as database connection details.

.B \fB[logging]\fP
Logging configuration. See also \X'tty: link #logging'\fI\%logging\fP\X'tty: link' section.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.level\fP
One of \fBTRACE\fP, \fBDEBUG\fP, \fBINFO\fP, \fBWARNING\fP,
\fBERROR\fP, or \fBCRITICAL\fP (default: \fBWARNING\fP)
.sp
\fBINFO\fP level messages are reserved for clients when tasks begin running.
There are numerous WARNING events (e.g., non\-zero exit status of a task).
\fBDEBUG\fP level messages signal component thread start/stop and individual task
level behavior. \fBTRACE\fP contains detailed information on all other behavior,
particular iterative messages while components are waiting for something.
.sp
\fBERROR\fP messages track when things fail but the application can continue; e.g.,
when command template expansion fails on an individual task.
.sp
\fBCRITICAL\fP messages are emitted when the application will halt or crash.
Some of these are expected (such as incorrect command\-line arguments) but in
the event of an uncaught exception within the application a full traceback is
written to a file and logged.
.TP
.B \fB\&.datefmt\fP
Date/time format, standard codes apply (default: \fB\(aq%Y\-%m\-%d %H:%M:%S\(aq\(ga\fP)
.TP
.B \fB\&.format\fP
Log message format.
.sp
Default set by the “default” \fBlogging.style\fP\&.
See the \X'tty: link https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes'\fI\%available attributes\fP\X'tty: link'
defined by the underlying Python logging interface.
.sp
Additional attributes provided beyond the standard include \fIapp_id\fP, \fIhostname\fP, \fIhostname_short\fP,
\fIrelative_name\fP, time formats in \fIelapsed\fP, \fIelapsed_ms\fP, \fIelapsed_delta\fP, and \fIelapsed_hms\fP,
as well as all ANSI colors and formats as \fIansi_x\fP where x is one of \fIreset\fP, \fIbold\fP, \fIfaint\fP,
\fIitalic\fP, \fIunderline\fP, \fIblack\fP, \fIred\fP, \fIgreen\fP, \fIyellow\fP, \fIblue\fP, \fImagenta\fP, \fIcyan\fP, \fIwhite\fP, and
\fIansi_level\fP contains the standard color for the current message severity level.
.TP
.B \fB\&.style\fP
Presets for \fBlogging.format\fP which can be difficult to define correctly.
Options are \fIdefault\fP, \fIdetailed\fP, \fIdetailed\-compact\fP, and \fIsystem\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB[database]\fP
Database configuration and connection details.
See also \X'tty: link #database'\fI\%database\fP\X'tty: link' section.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.provider\fP
Database provider (default: ‘sqlite’). Supported alternatives include
‘postgres’ (or compatible). Support for other providers may be considered in
the future.
.TP
.B \fB\&.file\fP
Only applicable for SQLite provider.
SQLite does not understand any other connection detail.
.TP
.B \fB\&.database\fP
Name for database. Not applicable for SQLite.
.TP
.B \fB\&.schema\fP
Not applicable for all RDMS providers.
For Postgres the default schema is \fBpublic\fP\&.
Specifying the schema may be useful for having multiple instances within the same database.
.TP
.B \fB\&.host\fP
Hostname or address of database server (default: \fIlocalhost\fP).
.TP
.B \fB\&.port\fP
Port number to connect with database server.
The default value depends on the provider, e.g., 5432 for Postgres.
.TP
.B \fB\&.user\fP
Username for databaser server account.
If provided a \fBpassword\fP must also be provided.
Default is the local account.
.TP
.B \fB\&.password\fP
Password for database server account.
If provided a \fBuser\fP must also be provided.
Default is the local account.
.sp
See also note on \fB_env\fP and \fB_eval\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.echo\fP
Special parameter enables verbose logging of all database transactions.
.TP
.B \fB[connection_args]\fP
Specify additional connection details for the underlying SQL dialect provider,
e.g., \fBsqlite3\fP or \fBpsycopg2\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB*\fP
Any additional arguments are forwarded to the provider, e.g., \fBencoding = \(aqutf\-8\(aq\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB[server]\fP
Section for \fIserver\fP workflow parameters.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.bind\fP
Bind address (default: \fIlocalhost\fP).
.sp
When running locally, the default is recommended. To allow remote \fIclients\fP to connect
over the network, bind the server to \fI0.0.0.0\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.port\fP
Port number (default: \fI50001\fP).
.sp
This is an arbitrary choice and simply must be an available port. The default option chosen
here is typically available on most platforms and is not expected by any known major software.
.TP
.B \fB\&.auth\fP
Cryptographic authentication key to connect with server (default: \fI<not secure>\fP).
.sp
The default \fIKEY\fP used by the server and client is not secure and only a place holder.
It is expected that the user choose a secure \fIKEY\fP\&. The \fIcluster\fP automatically generates
a secure one\-time \fIKEY\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.queuesize\fP
Maximum number of task bundles on the shared queue (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
This blocks the next bundle from being published by the scheduler until a client
has taken the current prepared bundle. On smaller scales this is probably best and
is only of modest performance impact, limiting the scheduler from getting so far ahead
of the currently running tasks.
.sp
On large scale workflows with many clients (e.g., 100) it may be advantageous to allow
the scheduler to work ahead in selecting new tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\&.bundlesize\fP
Size of task bundle (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales. This is
used by the \fIsubmit\fP thread to accumulate bundles for either database commits and/or publishing
to the queue. If a database is in use, the scheduler thread selects tasks from the database in
batches of this size.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fB\&.attempts\fP
Attempts for auto\-retry on failed tasks (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
If a database is in use, then there is an opportunity to automatically retry failed tasks. A
task is considered to have failed if it has a non\-zero exit status. The original is not over\-written,
a new task is submitted and later scheduled.
.sp
Counterpart to the \fB\-r\fP/\fB\-\-max\-retries\fP command\-line option. Setting \fB\-\-max\-retries 1\fP
is equivalent to setting \fB\&.attempts\fP to 2.
.sp
See also \fB\&.eager\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.eager\fP
Schedule failed tasks before new tasks (default: \fIfalse\fP).
.sp
If \fB\&.attempts\fP is greater than one, this option defines the appetite for re\-submitting
failed tasks. By default, failed tasks will only be scheduled when there are no more
remaining novel tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\&.wait\fP
Polling interval in seconds for database queries during scheduling (default: \fI5\fP).
This waiting only occurs when no tasks are returned by the query.
.TP
.B \fB\&.evict\fP
Eviction period in seconds for clients (default: \fI600\fP).
.sp
If a client fails to register a heartbeat after this period of time it is considered
defunct and is evicted. When there are no more tasks to schedule the server sends a
disconnect request to all registered clients, and waits until a confirmation is
returned for each. If a client is defunct, this will hang the shutdown process.
.UNINDENT

.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.bundlesize\fP
Size of task bundle (default: \fI1\fP).
.sp
The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales.
.sp
Using larger bundles is a good idea for larger distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client. It is also a good
idea to coordinate bundle size between the client and server so that the client returns the
same sized bundles that it receives.
.sp
See also \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fB\&.bundlewait\fP
Seconds to wait before flushing task bundle (default: \fI5\fP).
.sp
If this period of time expires since the previous bundle was returned to the server,
the current group of finished tasks will be pushed regardless of \fIbundlesize\fP\&.
.sp
For larger distributed workflows it is a good idea to make this waiting period sufficiently
long so that most bundles are returned whole.
.sp
See also \fB\-w\fP/\fB\-\-bundlewait\fP command\-line option.
.TP
.B \fB\&.heartrate\fP
Interval in seconds between heartbeats sent to server (default \fI10\fP).
.sp
Even on the largest scales the default interval should be fine.
.TP
.B \fB\&.timeout\fP
Timeout in seconds for client. Automatically shutdown if no tasks received (default: never).
.sp
This feature allows for gracefully scaling down a cluster when task throughput subsides.
.UNINDENT

to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.
.sp
See also \fB\-b\fP/\fB\-\-bundlesize\fP command\-line option.

Executors will send a progression of SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
If the process still persists the executor itself will shutdown.

.B \fB[autoscale]\fP
Define an autoscaling policy and parameters.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.policy\fP
Either \fIfixed\fP or \fIdynamic\fP\&.
.sp
A \fIfixed\fP policy will seek to maintain a definite size and allows for recovery in the
event that clients halt for some reason (e.g., due to expected faults or timeouts).
.sp
A \fIdynamic\fP policy maintains a minimum size and grows up to some maximum size
depending on the observed \fItask pressure\fP given the specified scaling factor.
.sp
See also \fB\&.factor\fP, \fB\&.period\fP, \fB\&.size.init\fP, \fB\&.size.min\fP, and \fB\&.size.max\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.factor\fP
Scaling factor (default: 1).
.sp
A dimensionless quantity used by the \fIdynamic\fP policy.
This value expresses some multiple of the average task duration in seconds.
.sp
The autoscaler periodically checks \fBtoc / (factor x avg_duration)\fP, where
\fBtoc\fP is the estimated time of completion for all remaining tasks given current
throughput of active clients. This ratio is referred to as \fItask pressure\fP, and if
it exceeds 1, the pressure is considered \fIhigh\fP and we will add another client if
we are not already at the maximum size of the cluster.
.sp
For example, if the average task length is 30 minutes, and we set \fBfactor = 2\fP, then if
the estimated time of completion of remaining tasks given currently connected executors
exceeds 1 hour, we will scale up by one unit.
.sp
See also \fB\&.period\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\&.period\fP
Scaling period in seconds (default: 60).
.sp
The autoscaler waits for this period of time in between checks and scaling events.
A shorter period makes the scaling behavior more responsive but can effect database
performance if checks happen too rapidly.
.TP
.B \fB[size]\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB\&.init\fP
Initial size of cluster (default: 1).
.sp
When the the cluster starts, this number of clients will be launched.
For a \fIfixed\fP policy cluster, this should be given with a \fB\&.min\fP size, and likely
the same value.
.TP
.B \fB\&.min\fP
Minimum size of cluster (default: 0).
.sp
Regardless of autoscaling policy, if the number of launched clients drops below this
value we will scale up by one. Allowing \fBmin = 0\fP is an important feature for
efficient use of computing resources in the absence of tasks.
.TP
.B \fB\&.max\fP
Maximum size of cluster (default: 2).
.sp
For a \fIdynamic\fP autoscaling policy, this sets an upper limit on the number of launched
clients. When this number is reached, scaling stops regardless of task pressure.

.SH DATABASE
.sp
The program can operate entirely within memory and does not require a database.
This is desirable for ad\-hoc, short\-lived, or in extreme high\-throughput scenarios.
However, some capabilities are only possible when a database is active
(such as server restart, task retry, task history, etc).
.sp
Connection details must to be specified by your configuration.
This can be entirely through environment variables or within files.
SQLite is automatically initialized upon opening the connection but
Postgres must be explicitly initialized via \fBhs initdb\fP or at launch with
the \fB\-\-initdb\fP command\-line option.
.sp
SQLite only needs the local file path.

.EE
.UNINDENT

Or via a single environment variable, \fBHYPERSHELL_DATABASE_FILE=/tmp/pipeline/task.db\fP\&.
.sp
The default \fIprovider\fP is SQLite; Postgres must be enabled. A local database with
local account authentication simply needs to know the database name.

The \fBport\fP is assumed to be 5432 but can be specified. If a \fBuser\fP is given then so too must
a \fBpassword\fP\&. The default \fIpublic\fP schema is assumed but can also be specified. Anything else
is forwarded to the database as a connection parameter; e.g., \fBencoding = \(dqutf\-8\(dq\fP\&.
.sp
Any parameter ending in the special suffixes \fB_env\fP or \fB_eval\fP are interpolated into the
configuration. E.g., \fBpassword_env\fP treats its value as the name of an environment variable
and \fBpassword_eval\fP executes its value as a shell command, both exposing \fBpassword\fP as the
expanded version.
.sp
The special \fB\&.echo\fP parameter can be set to \fBtrue\fP to enable verbose logging of all database
transactions. These will be emitted as \fBINFO\fP level messages.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
As stated for configuration, any environment variable prefixed as \fBHYPERSHELL_\fP
where the name aligns to the path to some option, delimited by underscores,
will set that option.
.sp
Example, \fBHYPERSHELL_CLIENT_TIMEOUT\fP maps to the corresponding configuration option.
The following environment variables must be specified as such and cannot be configurable
within files.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBHYPERSHELL_SITE\fP
The default site path for outputs is either the \fIuser\fP or \fIsystem\fP site based
on whether the program was run as root/admin. The \fIlocal\fP path is always the
current working directory for the program. If this environment variable is set
then it takes the place of the \fIlocal\fP site and used as the default.
.TP
.B \fBHYPERSHELL_CONFIG_FILE\fP
Under normal operations the program searches all three \fIsystem\fP, \fIuser\fP, and
\fIlocal\fP sites to load the full configuration in addition to all prefixed
environment variables. This can actually cause issues for scenarios with many
instances of the program running on the same file system, such as an HPC
cluster. In order to protect against unintended crashes from incidental
configuration changes, defining this environment variable specifies the one
and only path to a configuration file and all others will be ignored.
Setting this to empty results in no files being loaded (an environment
only runtime).

.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
