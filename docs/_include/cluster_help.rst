Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

FILE
    Path to input task file (default: <stdin>).

Modes
^^^^^

``--ssh`` *HOST*...
    Launch directly with SSH host(s). This can be a single host, a comma-separated list of hosts,
    or an expandable pattern, e.g., "cluster-a[00-04].xyz".

    See also ``--ssh-group`` and ``--ssh-args``.

``--mpi``
    Same as ``--launcher=mpirun``.

``--launcher`` *ARGS*...
    Use specific launch interface. This can be any program that handles process management on a
    distributed system. For example, on a *SLURM* cluster one might want to use ``srun``. In this
    case you would specify ``--launcher=srun``; however, the *ARGS* are not merely the executable
    but the full listing, e.g., ``--launcher='srun --mpi=pmi2'``.

Options
^^^^^^^

``-N``, ``--num-tasks`` *NUM*
    Number of task executors per client (default: 1).

    For example, ``-N4`` would create four workers, but ``-N4 --ssh 'cluster-a[00-01].xyz'``
    creates two clients and a total of eight workers.

``-t``, ``--template`` *CMD*
    Command-line template pattern (default: "{}").

    This is expanded by the client just before execution. With the default "{}" the input
    command-line will be run verbatim. Specifying a template pattern allows for simple input
    arguments (e.g., file paths) to be transformed into some common form; such as
    ``-t './some_command.py {} >outputs/{/-}.out'``.

    See section on `templates`.

``-p``, ``--port`` *NUM*
    Port number (default: 50001).

    This is an arbitrary choice and simply must be an available port. The default option chosen
    here is typically available on most platforms and is not expected by any known major software.

``-b``, ``--bundlesize`` *SIZE*
    Size of task bundle (default: 1).

    The default value allows for greater concurrency and responsiveness on small scales. This is
    used by the `submit` thread to accumulate bundles for either database commits and/or publishing
    to the queue. If a database is in use, the scheduler thread selects tasks from the database in
    batches of this size.

    Using larger bundles is a good idea for large distributed workflows; specifically, it is best
    to coordinate bundle size with the number of executors in use by each client.

    See also ``--num-tasks`` and ``--bundlewait``.

``-w``, ``--bundlewait`` *SEC*
    Seconds to wait before flushing tasks (default: 5).

    This is used by both the `submit` thread and forwarded to each `client`. The `client` collector
    thread that accumulates finished task bundles to return to the `server` will push out a bundle
    after this period of time regardless of whether it has reached the preferred bundle size.

    See also ``--bundlesize``.

``-r``, ``--max-retries`` *NUM*
    Auto-retry failed tasks (default: 0).

    If a database is in use, then there is an opportunity to automatically retry failed tasks. A
    task is considered to have failed if it has a non-zero exit status. Setting this value greater
    than zero defines the number of attempts for the task. The original is not over-written, a new
    task is submitted and later scheduled.

    See also ``--eager``.

``--eager``
    Schedule failed tasks before new tasks. If ``--max-retries`` is greater than one, this option
    defines the appetite for re-submitting failed tasks. By default, failed tasks will only be
    scheduled when there are no more remaining novel tasks.

``--no-db``
    Disable database (submit directly to clients).

    By default, a scheduler thread selects tasks from a database that were previously submitted.
    With ``--no-db`` enabled, there is no scheduler and instead the `submit` thread publishes
    bundles directly to the queue.

``--initdb``
    Auto-initialize database.

    If a database is configured for use with the workflow (e.g., Postgres), auto-initialize
    tables if they don't already exist. This is a short-hand for pre-creating tables with the
    ``hs initdb`` command. This happens by default with SQLite databases.

    Mutually exclusive to ``--no-db``. See ``hs initdb`` command.

``--no-confirm``
    Disable client confirmation of task bundle received.

    To achieve even higher throughput at large scales, optionally disable confirmation
    payloads from clients. Consider using this option when also using ``--no-db``.

``--forever``
    Schedule forever.

    Typically, the `cluster` will process some finite set of submitted tasks. When there are
    no more tasks left to schedule, the `cluster` will begin its shutdown procedure. With
    ``--forever`` enabled, the scheduler will continue to wait for new tasks indefinitely.

    Conflicts with ``--no-db`` and mutually exclusive to ``--restart``.

``--restart``
    Start scheduling from last completed task.

    Instead of pulling a new list of tasks from some input `FILE`, with ``--restart`` enabled the
    `cluster` will restart scheduling tasks where it left off. Any task in the database that was
    previously scheduled but not completed will be reverted.

    For very large workflows, an effective strategy is to first use the ``submit`` workflow to
    populate the database, and then to use ``--restart`` so that if the `cluster` is interrupted,
    it can easily continue where it left off, halting if nothing to be done.

    Conflicts with ``--no-db`` and mutually exclusive to ``--forever``.

``--ssh-args`` *ARGS*...
    Command-line arguments for SSH. For example, ``--ssh-args '-i ~/.ssh/my_key'``.

``--ssh-group`` *NAME*
    SSH nodelist group in config.

    In your configuration under ``[ssh.nodelist]`` can be one or more named lists. These lists
    should contain host names to associate with the group name.

    See `configuration` section.

``-E``, ``--env``
    Send environment variables. Only for ``--ssh`` mode, all ``HYPERSHELL_`` prefixed environment
    variables can be exported to the remote clients.

``--remote-exe`` *PATH*
    Path to remote executable on the client side.

    By default the executable path used to launch clients is the same as that for the cluster.
    This option is necessary for clients with a different install path on client hosts.

``-d``, ``--delay-start`` *SEC*
    Delay time in seconds for launching clients (default: 0).

    At larger scales it can be advantageous to uniformly delay the client launch sequence.
    Hundreds or thousands of clients connecting to the server all at once is a challenge.
    Even if the server could handle the load, your task throughput would be unbalanced,
    coming in waves.

    Use ``--delay-start`` with a negative number to impose a uniform random delay up to the
    magnitude specified (e.g., ``--delay-start=-600`` would delay the client up to ten minutes).
    This also has the effect of staggering the workload. If your tasks take on the order of 30
    minutes and you have 1000 nodes, choose ``--delay-start=-1800``.

``-c``, ``--capture``
    Capture individual task <stdout> and <stderr>.

    By default, the `stdout` and `stderr` streams of all tasks are fused with that of the `client`
    thread, and in turn the `cluster`. If tasks are producing output that needs to be isolated, the
    tasks need to manage their own output, you can specify a redirect as part of a ``--template``,
    or use ``--capture`` to capture these as ``.out`` and ``.err`` files.

    These are stored local to the `client`. Task outputs can be automatically retrieved via SFTP,
    see *task* usage.

``-o``, ``--output`` *PATH*
    File path for task outputs (default: <stdout>).

    If local only (not ``--ssh``, ``--mpi`` or ``--launcher``), then the *client* can redirect all
    *stdout* from tasks to some file *PATH* together.

``-e``, ``--errors`` *PATH*
    File path for task errors (default: <stderr>).

    If local only (not ``--ssh``, ``--mpi`` or ``--launcher``), then the *client* can redirect all
    *stderr* from tasks to some file *PATH* together.

``-f``, ``--failures`` *PATH*
    File path to write failed task args (default: <none>).

    The *server* acts like a sieve, reading task args from *stdin* and redirecting those original
    args to *stdout* if the task had a non-zero exit status. The *cluster* will run the *server*
    for you and if ``--failures`` is enabled these task args will be sent to a local file *PATH*.

``-T``, ``--timeout`` *SEC*
    Timeout in seconds for clients. Automatically shutdown if no tasks received (default: never).

    This option is only valid for an ``--autoscaling`` cluster. This feature allows for gracefully
    scaling down a cluster when task throughput subsides.

``-W``, ``--task-timeout`` *SEC*
    Task-level walltime limit (default: none).

    Executors will send a progression of SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGKILL.
    If the process still persists the executor itself will shutdown.

``-A``, ``--autoscaling`` [*MODE*]
    Enable autoscaling (default: disabled). Used with ``--launcher``.

    Specifying this option on its own triggers the use of the autoscaler, with the default
    *policy* or the configured policy. The *policy* can be specified directly here
    as either *fixed* or *dynamic* (e.g., ``--autoscaling=dynamic``). The default is *fixed*.

    The specified ``--launcher`` is used to bring up each individual instance of the client
    as a discrete scaling unit. This is different than using ``--launcher`` on its own where
    it specifies a single invocation that should launch all clients (e.g., like an ``mpirun``).
    Without this option, clients will simply be run locally.

    A *fixed* policy will seek to maintain a definite size and allows for recovery in the
    event that clients halt for some reason (e.g., due to expected faults or timeouts).

    A *dynamic* policy maintains a ``--min-size`` (default: 0) and grows up to some
    ``--max-size`` depending on the observed *task pressure* given the specified scaling
    ``--factor``.

    See also ``--factor``, ``--period``, ``--init-size``, ``--min-size``, and ``--max-size``.

``-F``, ``--factor`` *VALUE*
    Scaling factor (default: 1).

    A configurable, dimensionless quantity used by the ``--autoscaling=dynamic`` policy.
    This value expresses some multiple of the average task duration in seconds.

    The autoscaler periodically checks ``toc / (factor x avg_duration)``, where
    ``toc`` is the estimated time of completion for all remaining tasks given current
    throughput of active clients. This ratio is referred to as *task pressure*, and if
    it exceeds 1, the pressure is considered *high* and we will add another client if
    we are not already at the given ``--max-size`` of the cluster.

    For example, if the average task length is 30 minutes, and we set ``--factor=2``, then if
    the estimated time of completion of remaining tasks given currently connected executors
    exceeds 1 hour, we will scale up by one unit.

    See also ``--period``.  Only valid with ``--autoscaling``.

``-P``, ``--period`` *SEC*
    Scaling period in seconds (default: 60).

    The autoscaler waits for this period of time in between checks and scaling events.
    A shorter period makes the scaling behavior more responsive but can effect database
    performance if checks happen too rapidly.

    Only valid with ``--autoscaling``.

``-I``, ``--init-size`` *SIZE*
    Initial size of cluster (default: 1).

    When the cluster starts, this number of clients will be launched.
    For a *fixed* policy cluster, this should be given with a ``--min-size``, and likely
    the same value.

    Only valid with ``--autoscaling``.

``-X``, ``--min-size`` *SIZE*
    Minimum size of cluster (default: 0).

    Regardless of autoscaling policy, if the number of launched clients drops below this
    value we will scale up by one. Allowing ``--min-size=0`` is an important feature for
    efficient use of computing resources in the absence of tasks.

    Only valid with ``--autoscaling``.

``-Y``, ``--max-size`` *SIZE*
    Maximum size of cluster (default: 2).

    For a *dynamic* autoscaling policy, this sets an upper limit on the number of launched
    clients. When this number is reached, scaling stops regardless of task pressure.

    Only valid with ``--autoscaling``.
