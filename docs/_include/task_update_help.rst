Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

ARGS...
    Assignment pairs for update.

Options
^^^^^^^

``--cancel``
    Cancel specified tasks.

    Cancelling a task means it will no longer be scheduled.
    This is done by setting the `schedule_time` to `now` and the `exit_status` to -1.
    A task cannot be cancelled after it is sent to remote clients.

``--revert``
    Revert specified tasks.

    A reverted task retains its ID and submit info along with any tags.
    It will be as if it were new and never scheduled.

``--delete``
    Delete specified tasks.

    Deleting a task fully drops the record from the database.
    All task information will be lost and not recoverable.

``--remove-tag`` *TAG...*
    Strip the specified `tag` from task records.


``-w``, ``--where`` *COND...*
    List of conditional statements to filter results (e.g., ``-w 'duration >= 600'``).

    Operators include ``==``, ``!=``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``<``, ``~``.
    The ``~`` operator applies a regular expression.

``-t``, ``--with-tag`` *TAG*...
    Filter on one or more tags. (e.g., ``-t special`` or ``-t file:a``).

    Leaving the `value` unspecified will return any task for which the `key` exists.
    Specifying a full `key`:`value` pair will match on both.

``-s``, ``--order-by`` *FIELD* ``[--desc]``
    Order results by field. Optionally, in descending order.

    When used in an update command, a ``--limit`` is required.
    For example, to delete the most recently submitted task,
    ``--order-by submit_time --desc --limit 1``.

``-l``, ``--limit`` *NUM*
    Limit the number of results.

``-F``, ``--failed``
    Alias for ``-w 'exit_status != 0'``.

``-S``, ``--succeeded``
    Alias for ``-w 'exit_status == 0'``.

``-C``, ``--completed``
    Alias for ``-w 'exit_status != null'``.

``-R``, ``--remaining``
    Alias for ``-w 'exit_status == null'``.

``-f``, ``--no-confirm``
    Do not ask for confirmation.

    The program first checks the number of affected tasks.
    The user must confirm the update interactively unless provided with
    ``--no-confirm``.

Legacy Mode
-----------

In previous releases of the software the update command had the following signature.
Executing the command with these three positional arguments is still valid.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

ID
    Unique UUID.

FIELD
    Task field name (e.g., "args").

VALUE
    New value.

    Use ``key:value`` notation for tasks.
    Updating ``tag`` will add or update any pre-existing tag with that ``key``.
