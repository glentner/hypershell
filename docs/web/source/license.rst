Many open source software projects are released under the GNU Public License,
or similar. For some, this is an appropriate choice. However, a project that
is released under a GPL licence cannot be used as part of any commercial product
or service (without it also being made open source).

Under the Apache Software License, anyone is free to use *hyper-shell* as part
of a proprietary, closed-source project. That's a good thing!
