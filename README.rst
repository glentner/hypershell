*HyperShell* is an elegant, cross-platform, high-throughput computing utility for
processing shell commands over a distributed, asynchronous queue. It is a highly
scalable workflow automation tool for *many-task* scenarios.

Built on Python and tested on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Several tools offer similar functionality but not all together in a single tool with
the user ergonomics we provide. Novel design elements include but are not limited to

* **Cross-platform:** run on any platform where Python runs. In fact, the server and
  client can run on different platforms in the same cluster.
* **Client-server:** workloads do not need to be monolithic. Run the server as a
  stand-alone service with SQLite or Postgres as a persistent database and dynamically
  scale clients as needed.
* **Staggered launch:** At the largest scales (1000s of nodes, 100k+ of workers),
  the launch process can be challenging. Come up gradually to balance the workload.
* **Database in-the-loop:** run in-memory for quick, ad-hoc workloads. Otherwise,
  include a database for persistence, recovery when restarting, and search.
